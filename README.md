# Flight Fare Prediction With Deployment

This project predicts flight fare based on the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The delployment was done using Flask app and project was depoyed on Heroku.

Steps performed in the project:

1.Import the dataset

2.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

3.Handle the categorical dataset

4.Fit the model using Random Forest Regressor model

5.Hyper parameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

6.Save the model

7.Deploy the model using Flask app on Heroku



## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
